<p>If you ever feel like getting away from the crowds, feel like going someplace pristine and unadulterated with tourism and its chaos, think of a trip to Madhya Pradesh. At the heart of our country, lies a raw diamond.

Whether it is the beauty of cascading waterfalls or wildlife parks with tigers you can actually spot (unlike Jim Corbett), Madhya Pradesh has it all. You might be aware that MP is home to the most famous erotic sculptures in the world, but could you have guessed that it also has the oldest cave paintings in the world or the oldest Buddhist Stupa in the world or even the largest wildlife sanctuary in Asia.

Madhya Pradesh does offer its popular spots like Khajuraho and Gwalior. But the real beauty of the state lies in the interiors. We have identified 4 offbeat spots for you to cover.

Jabalpur may seem like another bustling small town but don't be fooled. Merely 25km away from the town lies a little known secret of India -- The Dhuandhar Falls.

The majestic horseshoe shaped falls may even be termed as India's Niagara Falls. Literally meaning mist (smoke) from the stream, be ready to be drenched with the mist rising from the falls.

<p>The Khajuraho erotic temples are one of the top historical destinations in India. If you want proof that the Kama Sutra originated in India, Khajuraho is the place to visit. There are over 20 temples abounding in erotic sculptures. However, more than that, they show a celebration of love, life and worship.
The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a group of Hindu and Jain temples in Madhya Pradesh, India, about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi. They are one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India. The temples are famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures. 
Most Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela dynasty.[4] Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometers Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers. Of the various surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient Indian art. 
The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region.

<h3>Bandhavgarh national Park</h3>
<img src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/3NbfmR3sauIFDIFRj_O_YfO4viY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/491218145-56a3bf6d3df78cf7727f0205.jpg" >
<p>Bandhavgarh and Kanha National Parks are among the top national parks in India. Bandhavgarh, while being relatively difficult to reach and costly to visit, is the best place to see tigers in the wild in India. The park features dense green valleys and rocky hill terrain, with an ancient fort. In addition to tigers, the park has a large array of wildlife including sloth bears, deer, leopards, jackals, and birds.</p>

<h3>Kanha National Park</h3>

<p>Kanha National Park has the honor of providing the inspiration for Rudyard Kipling’s classic novel, The Jungle Book. It’s rich in lush saal and bamboo forests, lakes, streams and open grasslands. As well as tigers, the park abounds with barasingha (swamp deer) and an extensive variety of other animals and birds. Rather than offering one particular kind of animal, it provides an all-round nature experience. The park is well regarded for its research and conservation programs, and many endangered species have been saved there.</p>
<h3>Bhopal</h3>
 < img src="http://bhopalonline.org/place_of_tourist/MotiMasjidofBhopal.jpg">
<p>Madhya Pradesh's capital city, Bhopal, is perhaps best known for the tragic poisoning that occurred there in 1984, when a pesticide manufacturing plant leaked a mixture of deadly gases. The city has two main attractions -- mosques and museums. A particularly fascinating museum is the Tribal Museum, which showcases the tribes of the region and their lives. The Taj ul Masjid, Jama Masjid, and Moti Masjid are fine example of the city's rich Islamic heritage. There are also two large lakes, the Upper Lake and Lower Lake, inside the city limits.

 One of India's little-known UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Bhimbetka rock shelters, is situated about an hour from Bhopal inside Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary. There are more than ancient 700 rock shelters there, dating all the way back to the Paleolithic age. Many of them have paintings on the walls.</p>
